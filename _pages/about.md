I am a first-year PhD student at the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/), [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/), fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Sarah Rajtmajer] (https://ist.psu.edu/directory/smr48). I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Information Assurance from the [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/). My research focuses on enhancing privacy preservation in AI-driven systems and social networking platforms. I am committed to identifying privacy challenges and developing innovative solutions to protect user data in these fields. Prior to beginning my PhD, I spent over ten years working in the mobile internet industry.
