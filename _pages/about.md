I am a first-year PhD student at the College of Information Sciences and Technology, Penn State University. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Information Assurance from the University of Delaware. My research focuses on enhancing privacy preservation in AI-driven systems and social networking platforms. I am committed to identifying privacy challenges and developing innovative solutions to protect user data in these fields. Prior to beginning my PhD, I spent over ten years working in the mobile internet industry.
